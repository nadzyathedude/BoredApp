# MobileUp Android Template ðŸŒ€


Hi! This is a template for initializing an Android project in [MobileUp](https://mobileup.ru/).

## Creating Project

After cloning the template:

1. Replace `ru.mobileup.template` with the package name of your project.
2. Replace application name and icon to the correct ones.
3. Remove the pokemons feature. It is created as an example.
4. Replace error text resources with text for your project.

## Modules
The project is based on three gradle modules:

#### app
It pieces all the features together, contains `Application` and `Activity` classes. Also all tests are placed here.

#### core
It contains general purpose things: error handing, message showing, network, theme, utils, reusable widgets.

#### features
It consists of concrete features. Each feature has its own package which contains:
- DI configuration
- **ui layer** - components, Jetpack Compose UI
- **domain layer** - entities, interactors
- **data layer** - repositories, storages

### Git hooks
1. Runs detekt static code analysis and module graph validation before commit. Installation:
   `cp git_hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/ && chmod 0775 .git/hooks/pre-commit`

2. Adds issue prefix in every commit message according to branch name. Installation:
   `cp git_hooks/prepare-commit-msg .git/hooks/ && chmod 0775 .git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg`

### Good coding and happy day!ðŸ¤˜
